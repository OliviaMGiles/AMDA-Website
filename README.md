# AMDA-Website
Website for Applied Multiverse Dynamics Associated, a fictional corporation/agency that explores the multiverse through means that suspiciusly resemble a trading card game.

## About this project
My friend and I have been developing a card game for a couple of years. Along with this card game developed lore, and this lore grew and grew until we had the plot for a ~~card game anime~~ web serial. This website will be the hub for our creation. A tool to ease the creating of cards. A platform for our story! a site of patronage for our devoted followers! An arena for our games! An interactive experience bluring the line between our own world and the great literary multiverse!!!

&ast;Cough&ast; Sorry, I got carried away. Anyway, I hope to make something pretty cool here.
